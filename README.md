# Data-Warehousing-Using-SQL

This is a product and supply chain management project. The original database contains the 11 tables, with transactional data related to some company operations. The database includes data for products, suppliers, orders, customers, etc. In order to get some business insights, I Built the data warehouse by joining 8 tables and created a dashboard by **SQL**. Also, I attached a .twb file which I used for visualization through <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/workbook_Final/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">Tableau</a> .
